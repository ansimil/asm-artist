        description: "'The Pier' started after a visit to the German lakeside town of Waren. Like most of my pieces, 'The Pier' didn't begin with a pre-determined idea, but rather with a sound - the sound of water lapping up against the shore of the Müritz Lake. \n\nThe piece developed itself from this sound and finished as a simple poem of sorts - a metaphor for a possible reality. The process of composing was seen a way to deal with the place - to understand it. 'The Pier' was selected for and premiered at the Atemporánea International Festival for Contemporary Music in Buenos Aires, Argentina in July 2019.",

        title: "inside out",
        description: "'Inside Out' (2016) is a piece of concrète music which uses an Indian bell as the impetus for the exploration of different acoustic spaces - both real and imaginary. \n\n'Inside Out' uses the image of physically moving along the perimeter of the bell in order to experience different sound constellations and forms - from the vast open space of the inner bell to the harsh claustrophobic sounds heard as we move closer to the bell's exterior. \n\nThis relationship is embellished and emphasised through the additional employment of a ride cymbal and digital feedback.",

        description: "'The Drummer' is an ongoing compositional project started in June 2016 with acousmatic composer Sebastian Peter. A day was spent recording the sounds of one particular drum-kit, with the limitation that these recordings would be the only sonic material used in all subsequent compositions. \n\nThe aim was to expose the different approaches to composition, sonic material and narrative. To date both composers have produced two compositions each.",

It was completed as part of 'Klang Tour 2016', in which five artists visited five German cities in five days in order to complete one artistic action per day. \n\n'Over and Under' was started and finished in one day. Recordings were made on and below the Rügenbrücke and then arranged into a composition which was later diffused. During the performance sounds from the bridge above and water below mixed with the composition creating a unique listening experience.",
